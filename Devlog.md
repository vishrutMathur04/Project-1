I need to write 3 programs in Python named as Logger, Encryptor and Driver. The Driver is the main program which will activate the other 2 files using the Sub process module  and connects them using the input/output stream.

No thoughts as such from the last text

I am going to create a logger.py file to start working on my first function.
