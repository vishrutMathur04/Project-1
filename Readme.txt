This project includes three Python programs — driver.py, logger.py, and encrypt.py.
Run the driver with python controller.py mylog.txt to start; it will launch the logger and encryptor automatically.
All activity is logged in mylog1.txt and mylog2.txt. No compilation needed — just run the scripts from the command line.
